Overview
This project is a simple web-based Palindrome Checker, allowing users to input text or numbers and check if they are palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

How It Works
Users input text or numbers into the provided text field.
Upon clicking the "Check Palindrome" button, the program determines whether the input is a palindrome.
Palindromes are identified by ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
If the input is a palindrome, a message confirming this is displayed.
